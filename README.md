**WELCOME TO MY PROJECT PAGE!**

An overview of the project:
My plan is to explore the New York Citi Bike trip data occur during the first week of July 2018.

**Possible analysis /questions:**
- How frequent does overtime usage occur?
- Users demographic.
- Is there a peek of usage during rush hours?
- What are the popular trips for non-subcribers vs subcribers?

**Dataset description:**
- Citi Bike is New York's fast growing bike share system. First launched in 2013, it now has 750 stations across the boroughs more than 100,000 annual subcribers.
- The dataset is Citi Bike's trip history in the first week of July 2018.

**Source:**
- The data was taken from Citi Bike System Data: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

**Dataset Descriptive Statistics:**
- Trip duration's sample mean = 19.58409 (minutes)
- Trip duration's sample standard deviation = 297.9729 (minutes)
- Users's birth year's sample mean = 1979.192
- Users's birth year's sample standard deviation = 11.72437 (year)
- Bike pick up time (hour of the day)'s sample mean = 14.32145
- Bike pick up time's sample standard deviation = 4.909375
- Bike drop off time (hour of the day)'s sample mean = 14.47061
- Bike drop off time 's sample standard deviation = 4.985676

**Graphs:**

The gender data has left-skewed distribution and appear to be platykurtic.

The birth year data also has left-skewed distribution but appear to be leptokurtic. 75% of the data are within 1955 and 2002. The data also seem to have many outliers.

The pick up time data seem to be slightly left skewed

There are more male subcribers than female subcribers (given that nonsubcribers gender is unknown)

More than 75% users are subcribers vs less than 25% non-subcribers

**Confidence Intervals**
- Trip duration's mean 95 percent confidence interval: (1122.071,1228.020)
- User birthyear's mean 95 percent confidence interval: (1979.151,1979.227)
- Start time mean 95 percent confidence interval: (14.3069,14.3360)
