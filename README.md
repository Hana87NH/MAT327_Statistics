Welcome to my project page!

An overview of the project:
My plan is to explore the New York Citi Bike trip data occur during the first week of July 2018.

Possible analysis /questions:
- How frequent does overtime usage occur?
- Users demographic.
- Is there a peek of usage during rush hours?
- What are the popular trips for non-subcribers vs subcribers?

Dataset description:
- Citi Bike is New York's fast growing bike share system. First launched in 2013, it now has 750 stations across the boroughs more than 100,000 annual subcribers.
- The dataset is Citi Bike's trip history in the first week of July 2018.
