Welcome to my project page!

An overview of the project:
My plan is to explore the New York Citi Bike trip data occur during the first week of July 2018.
Possible analysis /questions:
- How frequent does overtime usage occur?
- Users demographic
- Is there a peek of usage during rush hours?
- What are the popular trips for non-subcribers vs subcribers?
